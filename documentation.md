# Project 2 Documentation - Mira Antolovich & Bobby Levin
## Process
We chose the API and made sure it worked by creating a prototype layout using the GIF-finder HW, then we proceeded to create a basic layout of what we wanted our project to look like. After connecting to the API, we started working on making the website look like our mock-up. Once we organised all the results in a CSS grid, we started working on the next and back buttons. After finishing that, we worked on the responsiveness of the website while making it more user-friendly. Finally we fixed up any issues, polished our display, and validated our code.

## Contribution
### Mira Antolovich
Mira did the extra search functions for the API along with the local storage. She did the basic semantic content, laying everything out for Bobby to put the information into. She also styled the main page; writing the CSS for the main containers, search bars, buttons, and font styles. Mira started the responsive design (setting up media quereies and setting up the grid to display our content) and got the page layout working on most basic screen sizes.
### Bobby Levin
Bobby did the basic connection for the API along with the search function. He then added some semantic content to Mira's framework, such as the "success" bar, the search bar, and the page buttons. Bobby created the page funtions for the webpage, allowing the user to view 100 results 10 at a time. Bobby also worked on fine-tuning the responsiveness (transition from one screen size to another), added text to explain the searching functions, worked to make the website more user-friendly, and cleaned up any CSS issues.
## Grade
We think we deserve an A.
