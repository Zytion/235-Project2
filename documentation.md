# Project 2 Documentation - Mira Antolovich & Bobby Levin
## Process
We chose the API and made sure it worked, then we proceeded to create a basic layout of what we wanted our project to look like. After connecting to the API, we started working on making the website look like our mock-up. Once we organised all the results in a CSS grid, we started working on the next and back buttons.
