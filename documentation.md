# Project 2 Documentation - Mira Antolovich & Bobby Levin
## Process
We chose the API and made sure it worked, then we proceeded to create a basic layout of what we wanted our project to look like. After connecting to the API, we started working on making the website look like our mock-up. Once we organised all the results in a CSS grid, we started working on the next and back buttons. After finishing that, we worked on the responsiveness of the website while making it more user-friendly.

## Contribution
### Mira Antolovich
Mira did the extra search functions for the API along with the local storage. She did the basic semantic content, laying everything out. She also styled the recipe containers and search bars, buttons, and chose the font style. Mira started the responsive design and got the layout working. She also double-checked for spelling errors and made sure that the website was responsive.
### Bobby Levin
Bobby did the basic connection for the API along with the search function. He then styled the page and added some semantic content, such as the "success" bar and the search function. Bobby worked on fine-tuning the responsiveness and added text to explain the searching functions to make the website more user-friendly.
## Grade
We think we deserve an A.
